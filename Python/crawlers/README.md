This is my learning process of web crawlers.

Among this, pythonJobsGitHUb.py and remoteJobs.ipynb focus on the analysing of the data fetched, the other codes mainly focus
on different techniques in accessing information online, such as randomly change IP in case the website bans my IP when I visit 
the website too often.
